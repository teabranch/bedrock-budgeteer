## [Unreleased]
### Added
- **Comprehensive System Documentation**: Created complete documentation suite including system architecture, deployment guide, API reference, and visual diagrams to support development, deployment, and operations

### Changed
- **MAJOR: Automatic Restoration Flow**: Restoration workflows are now automatically triggered based on the refresh period set per API key in the database, eliminating the need for manual approval processes
- **Simplified Workflows**: Removed emergency override checks from both suspension and restoration workflows for streamlined operation
- **Faster Budget Monitoring**: Reduced budget monitor execution frequency from 15 minutes to 5 minutes for faster budget violation detection
- **Reduced Grace Period**: Reduced default grace period from 300 seconds (5 minutes) to 60 seconds (1 minute) to minimize suspension delay

### Fixed
- **Budget Monitor Decimal Conversion**: Fixed TypeError in budget monitor Lambda when handling grace_deadline_epoch from DynamoDB by implementing robust Decimal-to-float conversion with error handling for datetime.fromtimestamp() operations
- **Step Functions DynamoDB Timestamp Error**: Fixed ValidationException in suspension and restoration workflows where ISO timestamp strings were incorrectly stored as numeric values in DynamoDB epoch fields
